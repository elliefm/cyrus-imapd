Description:

Prevents a bug in search, where queries may exceed the search normalization limit.

Config changes:

None. Implementations may want to revisit their search_normalisation_max settings, but its default value 1000 is a good conversative choice. Current server-grade hardware may use 20000 or more.

Upgrade instructions:

None.
