Making a New Major (x.y) Release

todo: convert to rst

Phase 1: preparation

branch off from master as cyrus-imapd-x.y
* add the new branch name to .travis.yml
* update the version numbers in docsrc/conf.py
* update docsrc/index.rst to describe this branch as stable, not dev
* create release notes indexes
* update version information in upgrade documentation
* update backend_version() in imap/backend.c to recognise the new
  stable and dev version numbers
* commit and push
* protect the branch
* create a proper tag (as per release steps) called cyrus-imapd-x.y-alpha0
  so that builds from this branch have the correct version
* push the tag

back on master:
* also add the new branch name to .travis.yml (could be ordered better...)
* update the version numbers in docsrc/conf.py - this is the next odd number
* cherry-pick the new stable release notes indexes (could be ordered better...)
* create new stub release notes for the dev version
* update version information in upgrade documentation
* cherry-pick the backend_version updates
* create a proper tag (as per release steps) called cyrus-imapd-x.y+1-alpha0
  so that builds from this branch have the correct version

on every other stable and oldstable branch:
* cherry-pick the backend_version updates.  older versions will require
  some handholding as this function was in a different file; see comments in
  the file.
* sometime before the actual release, release a new build from each of these
  branches containing the backend_version fixes, so that there is an upgrade
  path for murder users

on cyrusimap.org repo, update run-gp.sh to also build the website for the
new version number.  leave the root website as the previous stable website
for now

Phase 2: betas

* find and fix anything wrong
* pay close attention to changes required for upgrade documentation
* follow release process to build beta releases
* contact known package maintainers to have experimental packages built and
  tested.  Debian is especially useful for this, as their build farm targets
  lots of platforms.

Phase 3: release

* on cyrusimap.org repo, update run-gp.sh to build the root website from
  the new branch
* build new release following usual process, and this time update all the
  docsrc/conf.py's to regard this version as the stable version, etc.
